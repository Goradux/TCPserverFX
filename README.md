# TCPserverFX
TCP Server Chat JavaFX
This small app is a logical continuation of the previous mini project [TCPServerClientChat](https://github.com/Goradux/TCPServerClientChat). It can be paired with the [client](https://github.com/Goradux/TCPServerClientChat/blob/master/TCPClient.java) app from that project to check its functionality.

One of the ways to run the project is to export it to NetBeans or Eclipse and compile it from there.

The app's interface looks like this:
